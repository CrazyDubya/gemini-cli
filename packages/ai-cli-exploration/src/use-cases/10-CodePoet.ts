To understand recursion's graceful art,
First understand recursion's graceful art...
Each function calls itself, a beating heart,
That mirrors its own rhythm from the start.

Base case, the savior from infinite loop,
The exit door from mirror hall's reflection,
Without it, stack will overflowâ€”one scoop
Too many of self-referential affection.`;

In Silicon's valley where the servers hum,
Where bits and bytes dance through electric streams,
The coders type until their fingers numb,
Building cathedrals out of logic's dreams.

Each variable, a vessel for the truth,
Each loop, a meditation on the flow,
Each if-statement, the wisdom of our youth,
Deciding which path the program ought to go.

The terminal glows with verdant green text,
Compiling thoughts to executable art,
Debugging life itself, perpetually vexed,
By edge cases hidden in the heart.

So here we code, between the one and zero,
Creating worlds where we can be the hero.`;
