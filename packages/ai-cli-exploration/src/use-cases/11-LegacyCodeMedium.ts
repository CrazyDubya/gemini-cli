*The terminal flickers, a presence emerges*

"Greetings from 2008... jQuery was new... IE6 haunted our dreams...

This code you question was written during The Great Deadline of Q3...
We had 7 developers, 3 keyboards that worked, and 1 Stack Overflow account between us...

Why did we use 17 nested callbacks? 
Promises were but a promise... Async/await, a distant dream...

That global variable 'temp2FinalREALLY'?
It was temporary... 15 years ago...

The 3000-line function? 
It started as 50 lines... Then production happened...

Remember us not with scorn, but with understanding...
We did what we could with what we knew..."

The Spirits of Refactors Past whisper warnings:

üëª The Ghost of Rewrite #1 (2012):
"We tried to modernize... Backbone.js was the future... Now it too is legacy..."

üëª The Specter of Rewrite #2 (2015):
"Angular 1 to Angular 2... The migration that never ended..."

üëª The Phantom of Rewrite #3 (2018):
"Microservices will solve everything! Now we have 47 problems instead of 1..."

The Ancestral Wisdom:
‚Ä¢ The code that works has survived many who tried to kill it
‚Ä¢ Every refactor carries the curse of edge cases unknown
‚Ä¢ The legacy you mock today is the technical debt you write tomorrow

Proceed with caution, young developer. The code remembers.`;

*Arranging the artifacts: floppy disks, PS/2 keyboard, and a CRT monitor*

I sense... strong energies from the Subversion era...
The comments speak of pain... "Fixed Bob's fix to Alice's fix"...

The spirits reveal:
‚Ä¢ This code has weathered 5 framework migrations
‚Ä¢ It has been "temporarily" patched 147 times
‚Ä¢ 12 developers have left their mark (and their tears)
‚Ä¢ It processes 40% of your critical business logic
‚Ä¢ The last person who fully understood it retired in 2019

Message from beyond:
"If it works, don't touch it. If you must touch it, document everything.
The code you write today will be someone else's haunted house tomorrow."

*A ghostly README.txt appears: "Here be dragons"*`;
